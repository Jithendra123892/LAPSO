## üéØ **What LAPSO Actually Does**

### **‚úÖ Real Capabilities**
- Provides **genuinely better location accuracy** through multi-source fusion
- Offers **automatic updates** instead of manual refresh requirement
- Includes **actual device control commands** that Microsoft lacks
- Tracks **complete location history** not available in Microsoft's solution
- Supports **multiple operating systems** beyond Windows-only limitation
- Ensures **complete privacy control** through self-hosting
- Guarantees **always free** usage with no subscription dependencies

### **‚ùå What LAPSO Doesn't Claim**
- Not military-grade security (standard web app security)
- Not centimeter-level accuracy (realistic 3-10m accuracy)
- Not AI-powered (no artificial intelligence claims)
- Not quantum anything (no quantum buzzwords)
- Not enterprise-grade (self-hosted solution)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Honest Limitations**
- Requires self-setup and basic technical knowledge
- Community support only, no professional support
- Device agents need installation on each device
- Accuracy depends on available location sources
- Self-hosted means you manage the infrastructure
