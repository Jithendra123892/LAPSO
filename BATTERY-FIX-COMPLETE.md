# ðŸ”‹ Battery Collection Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem Identified
Battery metrics were only working for laptops (like yours) but failing for desktops and PCs without battery hardware.

## Root Cause
- **Agent behavior**: PowerShell agent returned `$null` when no battery detected
- **Server validation**: Spring Boot had strict validation `@Min(value = 0)` which rejected null values
- **Result**: Heartbeats from desktop PCs failed silently due to validation errors

## Solution Applied

### 1. Agent Fix (laptop-tracker-agent.ps1)
**Changed line 214:**
```powershell
# OLD: $batteryPercentage = if ($battery) { $battery.EstimatedChargeRemaining } else { $null }
# NEW:
$batteryPercentage = if ($battery) { $battery.EstimatedChargeRemaining } else { -1 }
```

**What this does:**
- Laptops/tablets with battery: Send actual battery percentage (0-100)
- Desktops without battery: Send -1 to indicate "No Battery"

### 2. Server Fix (AgentDataController.java)
**Changed validation rules:**
```java
// OLD: @Min(value = 0, message = "Battery level must be between 0 and 100")
// NEW:
@Min(value = -1, message = "Battery level must be between -1 and 100 (-1 = no battery)")
@Max(value = 100, message = "Battery level must be between -1 and 100 (-1 = no battery)")
```

**What this does:**
- Accepts -1 as valid value for devices without battery
- Still validates 0-100 range for devices with battery
- Clear error message explaining -1 convention

## Testing Instructions

### For Desktop PCs (No Battery)
1. Install/reinstall agent: `C:\Program Files\LAPSO\laptop-tracker-agent.ps1`
2. Wait 30 seconds for heartbeat
3. Check server logs - should see: `âœ… Device updated: DESKTOP-NAME (Battery: -1%)`
4. UI will show "No Battery" or hide battery indicator

### For Laptops (With Battery)
1. Agent continues working as before
2. Battery percentage displays normally (0-100%)
3. Low battery alerts still work

## Build Status
âœ… **BUILD SUCCESS** - Project rebuilt with fixes applied

## Next Steps
1. Test Lock/Screenshot/Wipe commands from UI
2. Verify agents on both laptops and desktops can connect
3. Monitor agent logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified
- `src/main/resources/static/agents/windows/laptop-tracker-agent.ps1` (line 214)
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/AgentDataController.java` (lines 664-666)
