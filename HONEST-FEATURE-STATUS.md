## ⚠️ **PARTIALLY WORKING FEATURES**

### ⚠️ **Device Lock**
**Status:** WORKS BUT LIMITED  
**What It Does:**  
- ✅ Sends lock command to agent via WebSocket  
- ✅ Agent receives command  
- ✅ Agent locks Windows screen (rundll32 user32.dll,LockWorkStation)  
**Limitations:**  
- ❌ Only works if agent is running  
- ❌ User can unlock with password (not permanent lock)  
- ❌ Not "truly locking" like Apple's Activation Lock  
**How to Test:**  
1. Ensure agent is running  
2. Click "Lock" button in dashboard  
3. Windows lock screen appears  
**Reality:** This is a **screen lock**, not a **device lock**. User can still unlock with their password.

## ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED (Never Built)**

### ❌ **Screenshot Capture**
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**What Was Discussed:** Capture screenshots remotely  
**What Was Built:** Nothing  
**Why Not:** Never started implementation  
**To Implement:** Would need:  
1. Agent script to capture screenshot  
2. Upload to server endpoint  
3. Display in dashboard  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours of work

### ❌ **True Device Lock (Like Apple)**
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**What Was Discussed:** Lock device even after restart  
**What Was Built:** Only screen lock (rundll32 LockWorkStation)  
**Why Not:** Requires system-level changes:  
- BIOS/UEFI password  
- Windows registry modifications  
- TPM chip integration  
**Reality:** Cannot be done with a simple agent script. Requires:  
- Administrator privileges  
- System restart  
- BIOS-level locking  
**Estimated Time:** Not feasible with current architecture

### ❌ **Remote Wipe**
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**What Was Discussed:** Remotely wipe device data  
**What Was Built:** Nothing  
**Why Not:** Never started, requires careful implementation  
**To Implement:** Would need:  
1. Secure confirmation workflow  
2. Agent script to delete files/format  
3. Multiple safety checks  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours with safety measures

### ❌ **File Browser**
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**What Was Discussed:** Browse device files remotely  
**What Was Built:** Nothing  
**Why Not:** Never started implementation  
**To Implement:** Would need:  
1. Agent endpoint to list files  
2. Web UI file explorer  
3. File download/upload capability  
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours of work

## 🚀 **TO IMPLEMENT MISSING FEATURES**

If you want me to implement the missing features, I can do:

### **1. Screenshot Capture** (2-3 hours)
- Agent captures screenshot using PowerShell  
- Uploads to `/api/screenshots/upload`  
- Display in dashboard with thumbnail gallery  

### **2. Enhanced Device Lock** (1-2 hours)
While I can't do true BIOS-level locking, I can improve the current lock:
- Set Windows auto-lock timer to 1 second  
- Disable TaskManager (requires admin)  
- Show custom lock message  
- Log lock events  

### **3. Remote Wipe** (4-5 hours)
- Two-step confirmation with email code  
- Selective wipe (documents, pictures, etc.)  
- Full wipe (format drives)  
- Safety checks to prevent accidents  

### **4. File Browser** (5-6 hours)
- List files and folders  
- Download files  
- Delete files remotely  
- Search files by name

## 💡 **HONEST RECOMMENDATION**

**What's Working Well:**
- Core tracking features are solid  
- Battery alerts are real-time  
- No fake data anymore  
- Better than Microsoft in key areas (offline detection, battery alerts)  

**What Needs Work:**
- Lock is just a screen lock, not true device lock  
- No screenshot capability yet  
- No remote wipe  
- No file browser  

**My Suggestion:**
1. **Test current features first** - Login and verify 10 working features  
2. **Decide priority** - Which missing feature matters most?  
3. **Implement one at a time** - Screenshots would be quickest to add
